# CISC-324-Lab-W25

Welcome to the CISC 324 Lab for Winter 2025. This repository will be used to distribute lab materials and assignments.

<!-- ## How the lab will be structured

In this course, we will use the xv6-riscv operating system as our core learning platform. You'll work directly with its source code to understand operating system concepts in practice.

The lab materials are organized as follows:
- Each lab has its own dedicated directory (Lab1, Lab2, etc.)
- Lab materials, instructions, and assignments will be provided in the respective directories
- Source code modifications and implementations will be done within these lab-specific folders
- Additional resources and documentation will be distributed as needed throughout the term -->

## A brief introduction to xv6-riscv

xv6-riscv is an educational operating system developed by MIT for teaching operating system concepts. It's a modern reimplementation of Unix V6 using RISC-V architecture, making it an excellent learning tool for understanding OS fundamentals.

Key features and advantages:

- Clean, minimal codebase that's easy to understand
- Well-documented implementation of core OS concepts
- Practical platform for experimenting with OS modifications
- Modern architecture support (RISC-V)

The original xv6 was created by Frans Kaashoek, Robert Morris, and Russ Cox, with the RISC-V port developed by the MIT PDOS group. Special thanks to all contributors who maintain this valuable educational resource. For more information, visit the [xv6 GitHub repository](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv)

## What is RISC-V?

RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) based on reduced instruction set computing (RISC) principles. It's designed to be simple, extensible, and suitable for a wide range of applications, from embedded systems to supercomputers.
